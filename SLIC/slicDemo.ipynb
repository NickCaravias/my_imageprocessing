    "This shows [Simple Linear Iterative Clustering](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/07/28/a-slic-superpixel-tutorial-using-python/) at work to show superpixel segmentation of images. We'll split this up to look at the algorithm in detail. [`skimage`](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.segmentation.html) includes numerous segmentation methods, but we're interested here in understanding the details."
